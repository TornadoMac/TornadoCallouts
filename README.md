# TornadoCallouts (Mini Callout Pack) for LSPD First Response 0.4.9

Introducing TornadoCallouts - a fresh, exciting mini callout pack designed to enhance your LSPD First Response patrols in Grand Theft Auto V. Developed to create a more dynamic and immersive policing experience, TornadoCallouts offers a variety of unique scenarios that add an extra layer of realism to your game.

## IMPORTANT UPDATE ##

If you are updating from 1.0.3 and below, go into plugins/LSPDFR and remove the old .dll because I renamed the plugin and removed the “s” from TornadosCallouts. If you don’t remove the old .dll, it will potentially interfere. This is a one-time thing. My apologies. 

## I'D LIKE YOU TO BE ADVISED THIS CALLOUT PACK IS IN ALPHA. PLEASE REPORT ANY ISSUES [IN THE ISSUES TAB](https://github.com/TornadoMac/TornadoCallouts/issues).
